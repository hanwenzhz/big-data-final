# big-data-final
My final project would be a near clone of the flight and weather app developed throughout the class. In addition to search delay by route, I also add a feature to the web app to search delay by airport.

Intellij project is in app directory and the command to generate hbase and hive is in hbase.hql.

The speed layer and kafka command is the same as it is in class.

My app works locally on the port 3199. Below is the screenshots of the app.
